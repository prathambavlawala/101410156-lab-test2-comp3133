This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

To generate a new component, directive, pipe, service, class, guard, interface, enum, or module, use the following commands:

- `ng generate component <component-name>`
- `ng generate directive <directive-name>`
- `ng generate pipe <pipe-name>`
- `ng generate service <service-name>`
- `ng generate class <class-name>`
- `ng generate guard <guard-name>`
- `ng generate interface <interface-name>`
- `ng generate enum <enum-name>`
- `ng generate module <module-name>`

## Build

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. You can deploy this directory to your web server.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will launch the test runner and provide feedback in the terminal about the status of your tests.

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. Before running this command, make sure to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities, such as Protractor or Cypress.

## Code Linting

You can lint your Angular project by running:

```bash
ng lint
```

This will check your code for any stylistic or programming errors and recommend improvements.
